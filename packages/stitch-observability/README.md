# stitch-observability

Shared OpenTelemetry tracing setup + instrumentation for Stitch services, so
every service traces the same way and **interactions between services land in
one trace**.

```python
from stitch.observability import (
    configure_tracing,
    instrument_fastapi,
    instrument_httpx,
    shutdown_tracing,
    OTelSettings,
)

provider = configure_tracing(
    service_name="stitch-api",
    enabled=settings.otel_enabled,
    exporter=settings.otel_traces_exporter,
    otlp_endpoint=settings.otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint,
    sample_ratio=settings.otel_sample_ratio,
)
if provider is not None:
    instrument_fastapi(app)  # on the constructed app, before it serves
    instrument_httpx()  # outbound calls inject W3C traceparent
# ... shutdown_tracing(provider) on exit
```

- **`OTelSettings`** — pydantic-settings mixin with the shared `OTEL_*` fields;
  a service's `Settings` inherits it.
- **`instrument_httpx()`** — the propagation piece: outbound `httpx` calls carry
  `traceparent`, so a downstream service (FastAPI-instrumented) continues the
  same trace rather than starting a disconnected one.
- **`instrument_sqlalchemy(engine)`** — per-query spans for a (sync) engine; pass
  `async_engine.sync_engine` for an `AsyncEngine`.
- Exporter modes: `console` (spans → structured stdout logs, no sidecar),
  `otlp` (→ collector/Jaeger), `none` (disabled).

Each Stitch service wires this up at startup with `setup_fastapi_tracing(app, ...)`
— a convenience that calls `configure_tracing` then `instrument_fastapi(app)`
(+ optional `instrument_httpx()`) in the right order — after the app and its
middleware are constructed, and `shutdown_tracing(provider)` on exit. SQLAlchemy
engines are instrumented separately via `setup_sqlalchemy_tracing(engine, ...)`,
since they're created lazily (often after startup).
